# RetentionIQ
Employee attrition software

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition using a Random Forest Classifier. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and feature importance visualization. The model utilizes numerical scaling, one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and hyperparameter tuning through grid search.

### Load Data: 
The data is loaded and preprocessed via the function in data.py.

### Model Training:
Train the Random Forest model using the code in model.py.

### Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using functions in evaluation.py.

### Feature Importance: 
Use features.py to visualize the top 10 most important features in the model.
